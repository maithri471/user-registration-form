## Linux 
To change the permissions of a file so that only the owner can read and write to it, we can use the chmod command in a Unix-like operating system.

Command:
```sh
chmod 600 <filename>
```
### Explanation:
* chmod: Command to change file permissions.
* 600: Sets the permissions so that:
* The owner has read (4) and write (2) permissions, totaling 6.
* Group and others have no permissions (0).
* filename: Replace this with the actual name of the file you want to modify.
* This command ensures that only the file owner can read and write the file, keeping it secure from other users.

## Step-by-Step Example
### Check the current permissions:

To see the current permissions of example.txt, use:
```sh
ls -l styles.css
```
This output looks like:
```sh
-rw-r--r--@ 1 maxy  staff  1361 Oct 25 10:53 styles.css
```
Here, **-rw-r--r--** indicates that the owner has read and write permissions, while group and others have read permissions.
### Change the permissions:

Use chmod 600 to restrict permissions so that only the owner has read and write access:
```sh
chmod 600 styles.css
```
### Verify the permissions:

Run ls -l example.txt again to confirm the change:
```sh
ls -l styles.css
```
The output should now show:
```sh
-rw-------@ 1 maxy  staff  1361 Oct 25 10:53 styles.css
```
**-rw-------** means that only the owner can read and write to the file, while the group and others have no access.

This command ensures that only the fileâ€™s owner can read and write to styles.css, keeping it private and secure from other users.
