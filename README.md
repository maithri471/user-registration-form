Password input: Uses type="password" to hide the password characters as they’re entered.
Explanation of CSS Enhancements

Explanation of JavaScript Enhancements
Email Validation:
Uses a regular expression to check if the email format is valid. If it’s not, an error message is shown.
Password Validation:
Ensures the password is at least 8 characters, contains a number, and an uppercase letter using a regular expression. Gives an error if it doesn’t meet these criteria.
Error Display:
Error messages (.error elements) are shown only if the corresponding validation fails, enhancing usability.
Form Submission:
If any validation fails, the form submission is prevented by returning false from the validateForm() function.
